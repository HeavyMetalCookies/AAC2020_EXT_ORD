
An example "EXT_ORD" project.
The [ AAC2020_EXT_ORD ] folder should be
NEXT TO (in the same folder as ) the
AAC2020 folder.

The presence of this folder with the
[ EXT_ORD.TXT ] file will determine which
EXTENSIONS are turned on and the [ priority/order ]
of loading those EXTENSIONS.

-3 == OFF , but negative (and so on...)
-2 == OFF , but negative
-1 == OFF , but negative (so you can turn something off and )
                         (remember it's priority)
0 == OFF

1 == HIGHEST priority
2 == Next priority
3 == Next Next priority
.... and so on ...
